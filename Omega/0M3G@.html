      <p>Omega is the largest and most-read reference work in history.[3] It is consistently one of the 15 most popular
        websites ranked by Alexa; as of 2021, Wikipedia was ranked the 13th most popular site.[3][4] It is hosted by the
        Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded mainly through donations.[5]</p>
      <p>On January 15, 2001, Jimmy Wales[6] and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia; Sanger coined its name as a
        portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia."[7][8] Wales was influenced by the "spontaneous order" ideas associated
        with Friedrich Hayek and the Austrian School of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian
        economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton.[9] Initially available only in English, versions in
        other languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 58 million articles, attracting
        around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 17 million edits per month (1.9 edits per second)
        as of November 2020.[10][11] In 2006, Time magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made
        Wikipedia the "biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world."[12]</p>
